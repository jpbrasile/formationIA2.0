## Background: Decarbonization of the Planet through Pulsed Electric Fields and AI

## **Global Objective:**
Accelerate the low-carbon transition by replacing polluting industrial processes with energy-efficient technologies, while rethinking work in the era of AI and robotics.

## **Context:** 
Technological Revolution - AI (e.g., DIGITS at $3000) and robotics (e.g., Unitree G1) are progressively making utility work obsolete, presenting an opportunity to redirect human activity towards noble causes like decarbonization.

## **Key Advantages & Scalability Strategy :**

*   **Modular & Scalable Technology:** The PEF technology and HV generators are inherently modular. This modularity is a key advantage for scaling power and transitioning from TRL 7 pilot to full industrial deployment.
Scaling up power will be achieved by parallelizing modular units, simplifying industrial scale-up and reducing deployment complexity.
*   **Pilot Plant as Market Catalyst:** The multi-process high power pilot plant (TRL 7) is not only for technical validation but also serves as a crucial market adoption catalyst.  Potential customers will be able to witness the PEF technology in operation, processing diverse industrial streams, directly reducing perceived risk and building confidence in the technology's real-world applicability and effectiveness.
*   **Risk & CAPEX Mitigation through Multi-Process Approach:** By splitting the development and validation effort across 10 diverse decarbonization processes and leveraging modularity, the project inherently mitigates both technical and financial risks. The modular design also reduces upfront CAPEX for industrial adopters, as they can incrementally scale their adoption based on their specific needs, starting with one or a few modular units.
